As we are using webpack as pre-processor, the normal version of Hugo is sufficient. If you prefer the extended version of Hugo anyway this will work as well. For comprehensive Hugo documentation, see gohugo.io.\nIf you want to use the theme from a cloned branch instead of a release tarball you\u0026rsquo;ll need to install webpack locally and run the build script once to create all required assets.\n# install required packages from package.json npm install # run the build script to build required assets npm run build Using the theme To prepare your new site environment just a few steps are required:\nCreate a new empty Hugo site.\nhugo new site demosite Switch to the root of the new site.\ncd demosite Install the Geekdoc theme from a release bundle (recommended) or from Git branch.\nCreate the minimal required Hugo configuration config.toml. For all configuration options take a look at the configuration page.\nbaseURL = \u0026#34;http://localhost\u0026#34; title = \u0026#34;Geekdocs\u0026#34; theme = \u0026#34;hugo-geekdoc\u0026#34; pluralizeListTitles = false # Geekdoc required configuration pygmentsUseClasses = true pygmentsCodeFences = true disablePathToLower = true # Required if you want to render robots.txt template enableRobotsTXT = true # Needed for mermaid shortcodes [markup] [markup.goldmark.renderer] # Needed for mermaid shortcode unsafe = true [markup.tableOfContents] startLevel = 1 endLevel = 9 [taxonomies] tag = \u0026#34;tags\u0026#34; Test your site.\nhugo server -D Option 1: Download pre-build release bundle Download and extract the latest release bundle into the theme directory.\nmkdir -p themes/hugo-geekdoc/ curl -L https://github.com/thegeeklab/hugo-geekdoc/releases/latest/download/hugo-geekdoc.tar.gz | tar -xz -C themes/hugo-geekdoc/ --strip-components=1 Option 2: Clone the GitHub repository Info\nKeep in mind this method is not recommended and needs some extra steps to get it working. If you want to use the Theme as submodule keep in mind that your build process need to run the described steps as well. Clone the Geekdoc git repository.\ngit clone https://github.com/thegeeklab/hugo-geekdoc.git themes/hugo-geekdoc Build required theme assets e.g. CSS files and SVG sprites.\nnpm install npm run build Deployments Netlify There are several ways to deploy your site with this theme on Netlify. Regardless of which solution you choose, the main goal is to ensure that the prebuilt theme release tarball is used or to run the required commands to prepare the theme assets before running the Hugo build command.\nHere are some possible solutions:\nUse a Makefile:\nAdd a Makefile to your repository to bundle the required steps.\nTHEME_VERSION := v0.8.2 THEME := hugo-geekdoc BASEDIR := docs THEMEDIR := $(BASEDIR)/themes .PHONY: doc doc: doc-assets doc-build .PHONY: doc-assets doc-assets: mkdir -p $(THEMEDIR)/$(THEME)/ ; \\ curl -sSL \u0026#34;https://github.com/thegeeklab/$(THEME)/releases/download/${THEME_VERSION}/$(THEME).tar.gz\u0026#34; | tar -xz -C $(THEMEDIR)/$(THEME)/ --strip-components=1 .PHONY: doc-build doc-build: cd $(BASEDIR); hugo .PHONY: clean clean: rm -rf $(THEMEDIR) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ rm -rf $(BASEDIR)/public This Makefile can be used in your netlify.toml, take a look at the Netlify example for more information:\n[build] publish = \u0026#34;docs/public\u0026#34; command = \u0026#34;make doc\u0026#34; Chain required commands:\nChain all required commands to prepare the theme and build your site on the command option in your netlify.toml like this:\n[build] publish = \u0026#34;docs/public\u0026#34; command = \u0026#34;command1 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; command 2 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; command3 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; hugo\u0026#34; Subdirectories Warning\nAs deploying Hugo sites on subdirectories is not as robust as on subdomains, we do not recommend this. If you have a choice, using a domain/subdomain should always be the preferred solution! If you want to deploy your side to a subdirectory of your domain, some extra steps are required:\nConfigure your Hugo base URL e.g. baseURL = http://localhost/demo/. Don\u0026rsquo;t use relativeURLs: false nor canonifyURLs: true as is can cause unwanted side effects! There are two ways to get Markdown links or images working:\nUse the absolute path including your subdirectory e.g. [testlink](/demo/example-site) Overwrite the HTML base in your site configuration with geekdocOverwriteHTMLBase = true and use the relative path e.g. [testlink](example-site) But there is another special case if you use geekdocOverwriteHTMLBase = true. If you use anchors in your Markdown links you have to ensure to always include the page path. As an example [testlink](#some-anchor) will resolve to http://localhost/demo/#some-anchor and not automatically include the current page!\nKnown Limitations Minify HTML results in spacing issues Using hugo --minify without further configuration or using other minify tools that also minify HTML files might result in spacing issues in the theme and is not supported.\nAfter some testing we decided to not spend effort to fix this issue for now as the benefit is very low. There are some parts of the theme where spaces between HTML elements matters but were stripped by minify tools. Some of these issues are related to gohugoio/hugo#6892. While recommendation like \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t depend on whitespace in your layout\u0026rdquo; sounds reasonable, it seems to be not that straight forward especially for something like embedded icons into the text flow.\nIf you still want to use Hugo\u0026rsquo;s minify flag you should at least exclude HTML file in your site configuration:\n[minify] disableHTML = true "},{"id":1,"href":"/de/_includes/","title":"Includes","parent":"Herzlich Willkommen zum OpenNMS Training","content":""},{"id":2,"href":"/de/","title":"Herzlich Willkommen zum OpenNMS Training","parent":"","content":"OpenNMS ist eine Open-Source Netzwerk-Management Plattform.
